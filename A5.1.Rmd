# **Assignment 5.1 - Linear Learning Machines**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.align="center", results='hide'}
library(fontawesome)
```

### Fundamental idea

- A learning machine using a hypothesis that forms linear combinations of the input variables is known as a linear learning machine.

- It tries to find a `hyperplane` for (> 2 Dim) and a `line` for (2 Dim) and tries to separate two classes from each other.

### Classification

A linear function $f(x)$ is commonly used for binary classification, for a target variable y $\in$ {-1, +1}, as follows:

For an instance set $x=(x_1, x_2,...,x_n)$ assign to +ve class if $f(x) \ge 0$, otherwise assign to -ve class,

where,

$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + b = <w.x> + b$ and <.> denotes the inner product.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A separating line for a 2D training set", out.width = '40%', fig.align="center"}

```

### Classification problems by LLM

In the areas of __Text mining__ such as Sentiment analysis for distinguishing between positive and negative words from twitter can be formulated as a candidate problem for LLM.

### Problems that cannot be classified by LLM

Problems where the input data is not linearly separable like boolean `XOR` gate.

```{r xor, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Geometric representation - XOR", out.width = '40%', fig.align="center"}

```
