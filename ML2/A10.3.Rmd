# **Assignment 10.3 - K-Dimensional-trees**

__What is the idea behind KD-trees? For which problems can a KD-tree be used to speed up the computation time?__

### KD-trees idea

- For _k_-NN, the speed of prediction is slow for a very large dataset because it has to look at every training example every time it makes a prediction.

- So this can be implemented efficiently, i.e., O(log n) at retrieval time, if we use smart data structures to facilitate the information retrieval for which we use a tree-based data structure like __KD-trees__.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Recursive partitioning into axis-aligned boxes in KD-trees"}
knitr::include_graphics("kd-tree.png")
```

### Operations

- If there is just one point, form a leaf with that point.

- Otherwise, split the points in half on one of the feature (e.g., one with
maximum variance).

- Recursively construct KD tree for the two sets of points.

- Each leaf node represents a bounding box of a region that contains a set of point.

### Problems KD-trees are used to speed-up the computation time

(Intuitive understanding) Consider 1-NN and a depth = 1 KD-tree:

- Identify which side the query point is on (e.g., the right side) by comparing
the value of the feature along the cutting dimension (e.g., x > 6),

- Compute the distances to the nearest neighbor,

- Check distance between the query point and the partition wall (axis-aligned). If this distance $d_w$ > distance to our closest neighbor, then we achieve our task. (Because we know that none of the data points inside that partition can be closer.) $\Rightarrow$ In this case, we get a 2x speed up!
